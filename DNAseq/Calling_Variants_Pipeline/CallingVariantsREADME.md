Notes:
2023-01-31 - This folder holds the pipeline for calling variants from capture sequencing/targeted DNA BAM files. Currently, the files are being made appropriate for public sharing on the 'Publication' branch. The README.md file will also be updated to reflect the new organization under /FLOMICS/DNAseq/ on github.

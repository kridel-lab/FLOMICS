# Follicular Lymphoma - integrating data from genome, transcriptome and methylome to discover new subtypes 

## Methylation

## Gene expression 

- Alignment from RNA-seq and extracting gene counts [[Code]](Code/BioinformaticsProcessing/RNAseq/AlignmentGeneCounts/
)
- Differential gene expression analysis [Code]
- Pathway enrichment analysis [Code] 

## Mutation profiling
